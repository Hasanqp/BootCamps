| Problem 1 | Inheritance: creating a Student class that extends Person using base constructor |
| Problem 2 | Polymorphism using virtual and override methods (Animal, Dog, Cat)               |
| Problem 3 | Applying polymorphism with a List of base class objects                          |

These exercises helped me understand how inheritance allows code reuse, how polymorphism enables different behaviors through a common base class, and how working with collections of base types makes code more flexible and extensible in real-world applications.
